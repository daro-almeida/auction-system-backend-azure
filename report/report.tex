\section{Introduction}
%briefly explain the context and goal of the system being developed
The goal of this work is to understand how services available in cloud computing platforms can be used for creating applications that are scalable fast, and highly available.
\subsection{Context}
This work consists in the design and implementation of the backend for an auction system like EBay and companion scripts for testing the system.

The system will manage auctions. Users can create auctions and bid on open auctions. User can also pose question about the product of an auction. A question can only be answered by the user that created the auction, and there can be only one answer for each question.
